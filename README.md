Spitzer_IRS
==

Repository of ancilliary files used in my research about galaxies from SINGS. Here are some functions and classes to 
analyse, manipulate and visualize data from Spitzer IRS and IRAC. There are some functions to be used with output from 
specific programms such as PAHfit and CUBISM.

The majority of the code is written in Python, trusting heavily in the astropy library but there is also some IDL here.
